🎨🧘 MindMate AI – UI/UX Design Guide
🧩 1. Visual Aesthetic Principles
Soft, Minimalist Design: Avoid visual noise. Use whitespace generously to promote mental clarity.

Rounded UI Elements: Buttons, cards, and inputs should have fully rounded corners (rounded-2xl or rounded-full) to feel gentle.

Subtle Shadows & Elevation: Use soft drop shadows to make content appear tactile and inviting (shadow-md, shadow-lg).

Micro-interactions: Add small animations (fade-ins, hover transitions, floating buttons) to make the interface feel alive and responsive.

🖌️ 2. Typography: Mood-Driven & Soothing
Element	Font Suggestion	Weight	Size	Style Tip
Headings (H1–H3)	Poppins or DM Serif Display	500–600	text-3xl to text-xl	Use soft but confident fonts
Body Text	Inter, DM Sans	400	text-base	Readable, open spacing
Journaling Text	Merriweather or Crimson Text	400–500	text-lg	Serene and reflective tone
Chat Bubbles	Quicksand	400	text-sm	Rounded, friendly typeface

🧠 UX Tip: Use slightly larger fonts for mental wellness apps to promote comfort and accessibility.

🖼️ 4. Inspirational Visuals & Calming Media
Include soothing AI-generated or static images throughout the app:

On the homepage: Rotating gallery of nature landscapes (e.g., waterfalls, sunrise, forests).

On mood pages: Contextual calming image per selected mood (e.g., peaceful lake for sadness).

On journal or tip pages: Minimal illustrations or line art of mindfulness, brain, or heart icons.

Example prompts for DALL·E or Gemini:

“A peaceful mountain lake at sunrise in watercolor style”

“Minimalistic line art of a brain with a heart inside”

“A cozy room with warm lighting and a journal on a desk”
